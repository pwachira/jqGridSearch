To reproduce the error,in IE8, go to the Archive tab, the orderdetails tab then on the drop down select orders, the grid should show up.
click on the search magnifying glass.
This is very important - change the column to any other than the 1st one - example, choose 'SendingApplication'.
For the operators, choose equal or not equal(contains always seems to work)
enter a search value.
without triggering any other clicks, click on the find button
You shoud see a validation error showing you that 'Field is required".

The app was a visual studio project but I have reduced it to where you can just view the index.html page - without needing a server side setup for asmx or aspx pages
